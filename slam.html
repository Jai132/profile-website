        <p>Imagine a robot in an unknown environment. How does it figure out where it is and what’s around it? This is where SLAM, short for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, comes in. SLAM is a core technology in robotics and autonomous systems, enabling machines to build a map of their surroundings while keeping track of their own location. The amazing thing? It does this simultaneously, solving two problems at once: "Where am I?" and "What does the world look like?"

            If you’re just starting out, the concept can seem tricky, but it’s actually pretty intuitive. Let’s dive into a basic, amateur-friendly overview of how SLAM works, its types, and why it’s important in modern technology.
